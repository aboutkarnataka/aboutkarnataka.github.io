            <p>Karnataka (ISO: Karnāṭaka, Kannada pronunciation: [kəɾˈnɑːʈəkɑ]) is one of the 28 states in India. Located in the southwestern region of India (11.5 degree North and 18.5 degree North latitudes and 74 degree East and 78.5 degree east longitude), it is the largest state in South India and the sixth largest in India. It was formed on 1 November 1956, with the passage of the States Reorganisation Act. Formally known as the State of Mysore, in 1973 it was renamed Karnataka. The state corresponds to the Carnatic region. Its district center and largest city is Bengaluru (Bangalore).</p>
            <p>Karnataka shares the border with the Arabian Sea in the west, Goa in the northwest, Maharashtra in the north, Telangana in the northeast, Andhra Pradesh in the east, Tamil Nadu in the southeast, and Kerala in the south. The state covers an area of 1,91,791 square kilometres (74,050.919089 sq mi), or 5.83 percent of the total geographical area of India. It is the only southern state to have land borders with all of the other 4 southern Indian sister states. With <a href="https://des.kar.nic.in/docs/Projected%20Population%202012-2021.pdf">61,130,704 inhabitants at the 2011 census</a>, Karnataka is the eighth largest state by population, comprising 31 districts and 226 taluks. Kannada, one of the Dravidian languages of South India, is the most widely spoken and official language of the state. Other minority languages spoken include Tulu, Kodava, Urdu, Konkani, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam ,Beary and Sanskrit.</p>
            <p>Though several etymologies have been suggested for the name Karnataka, the generally accepted one is that Karnataka is derived from the Kannada words karu and nādu, meaning "elevated land". Karu Nadu may also be read as karu, meaning "black" and nadu, meaning "region", as a reference to the black cotton soil found in the Bayalu Seeme region of the state. The British used the word Carnatic, sometimes Karnatak, to describe both sides of peninsular India, south of the Krishna.</p>
            <p>With an antiquity that dates to the paleolithic, Karnataka has been home to some of the most powerful empires of ancient and medieval India. The philosophers and musical bards patronised by these empires launched socio-religious and literary movements which have endured to the present day. Karnataka has contributed significantly to both forms of Indian classical music, the Carnatic and Hindustani traditions.</p>
            <p>The economy of Karnataka is the fourth-largest of any Indian state with ₹16.99 trillion (US$240 billion) in gross domestic product and a per capita GDP of ₹231,000 (US$3,200). Karnataka has the nineteenth highest ranking among Indian states in Human Development Index.</p>
